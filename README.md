How does soil composition affect the microbial communities associated with G. versiforme extraradical hyphae?

Null hypothesis:
Soil composition has no effect on microbial richness or composition.

I hypothesize that soils with greater organic carbon content will support more diverse communities (measured by richness) in association with fungal hyphae. More nutrients will allow for more niches in the environment, resulting in more rare taxa.

In addition, I hypothesize that different soil types will have different ERH microbiome compositions (Bray-Curtis).

Sequencing of the V4 region of the 16s rRNA gene with 515F (GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 806R (GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT) primers with Illumina MiSeq

3 ERH inoculated soil types were included with sand as a negative control (n = 9)
